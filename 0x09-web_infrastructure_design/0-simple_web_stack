1. A server is a device that hosts information/functionalities and provides it other devices/clients on a computer network.

2. The domain fundamentally serves as a tag or label that is associated with the IP address.

3. The DNS type is TLD(top level domain).

4. Basically the web server hosts web pages for web clients.

5. The application server hosts the back-end application/functionalities, mostly dynamic content.

6. The database holds and allows permitted data operations.

7. It uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

8. Infrastructure issues:
8.1 SPOF: A Single Point of Failure means that if any component in your infrastructure fails, the entire service will go down.

8.2 When you need to deploy new code or perform maintenance, the web server (Nginx) or the application server may need to be restarted, leading to downtime.

8.3 The infrastructure cannot handle an increase in traffic or load because all components are hosted on a single server.
